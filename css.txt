What is CSS?
CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

Cascading Meaning!
It means it flows like a water fall! 
So CSS means falling of styles from the most important ones to less important ones

What does CSS do?
CSS can make your website pretty!
It might be annoying when you are just getting started, but when you get comfortable, you will be able make some pretty websites

CSS Syntax!
--Example--
h1 {
    color: red;
}
--------------
This whole this is called a rulesets

In this example, h1 is a selector!
It will select which element to style!
However, this will make every h1 tag's content red!
We don't want that!
This is where class and id attribute from HTML comes in!
To select class, you will use . before the class name!
To select id, you will use # before the id name!
Then, you are going to be using {}!
Inside of {} you will be putting in property and value!
In this example, color is a property, and red is a value!

There are 3 ways of doing CSS!
1. Inline Style Sheet
2. Internal Style Sheet
3. External Style Sheet

What is Inline Style Sheet?
Inline Style Sheet is when you are using style attribute!
--Example--
<h1 style="color: red">Hello I'm Dolphin</h1>
-------------------------------------------
This is going to change the color of h1 tag!

What is Internal Style Sheet?
Internal Style Sheet is when you are using CSS syntax inside of HTML file
You are going to put CSS inside of <style></style> tag! <style> tag is going inside of <head> tag
--Example--
<head>
    <style>
        #hello {
            color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 id="hello">Hello I'm Dolphin</h1>
</body>
----------------------------------------

What is External Style Sheet?
External Style Sheet is when you are using CSS inside of CSS file not in HTML file!
You are going to link CSS file to HTML document
To create a CSS file use filename.css (normally style.css)
--Example of a file structure--
project
    ↳ index.html
    ↳ style.css
---------------------------------
inside of <head> tag, put <link> and connect to CSS
--Example--
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
--------------------------------------------
After that if you make any CSS styles, it will be displayed on HTML file!

--Example--
(inside of HTML file)
<h1 id="dolphin">Dolphin</h1>

(inside of CSS file)
#dolphin {
    color: yellow;
}
-----------------------------
Now the color of "Dolphin" will be yellow!

CSS importance!
If there are 2 or more different properties that goes to the same element,
it will follow higher importance

ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: 
1. !important (use after the value! However, don't use this a lot!)
2. Inline Style Sheet
3. # (id)
4. . (class)
5. tag
6. * (this means all)
