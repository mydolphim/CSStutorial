What is box model?
Box model determines how big the contents are!
There are 4 parts in box model!
Order from inside to outside: 
1. content
2. padding
3. border
4. margin

HOW TO SEE BOX MODEL?
Go into your browser or anything!
Then, right click in there.
After that, Click inspect (all the way at the bottom)
Next, use click computed in there (right next to styles)
If you see a box with 4 layers you success!
(color from outside to inside -> red, orange, green, blue)
Take a look at how they look like.


content - Where all the texts or other things go in. You can use width and height property to content
padding - This determines how much space is between content to a border or margin
border - border can have a lot of properties. There are be none, solid, dotted, etc.
margin - This is what determines how much space is between one element to another

content:
Use width and height to determine the size of an element!
HOWEVER, width and height property will not work with inline level element!
To do that, change the display to inline-block! (display: inline-block)
(We are going to learn about display later!)
h1 {
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
}

padding:
(long form)
h2 {
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 10px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    padding-left: 15px;
}
(short form)
h2 {
    padding: 10px 20px 10px 15px;
    /* 1st value = padding-top */
    /* 2nd value = padding-right */
    /* 3rd value = padding-bottom */
    /* 4th value = padding-left */
    /* It's going clock wise!*/
}

(If top & bottom is different, but right & left is the same)
h2 {
    padding: 20px 10px 15px;
    /* 1st value = padding-top */
    /* 2nd value = padding-right & padding-left */
    /* 3rd value = padding-bottom */
}

(If they top & bottom and right & left is the same)
h2 {
    padding: 10px 10px;
    /* 1st value = padding-top & padding-bottom */
    /* 2nd value = padding-right & padding-left */
}

(If all of them are the same (square))
h2 {
    padding: 10px;
    /* All of them are now have 10px */
}

border:
There are many types of borders!
List:
• none - lowest priority (EX: if border is collapsed the border will still be shown)
• hidden - highest priority (EX: even though border is collapsed, it will not going to be shown)
• solid - solid line (_______)
• dotted - dotted line (• • • • • •)
• dashed - dashed line (_ _ _ _ _)
• double - 2 lines (=====)
• groove - carved appearance (opposite of ridge) 
• ridge - extruded appearance (opposite of groove)
• inset - embedded appearance (opposite of outset)
• outset - embossed appearance (opposite of inset)

There are many properties!
• border-top-style
• border-right-style
• border-bottom-style
• border-left-style

We normally use border property
EX:

h2 {
    border: 1px solid black;
    /* This is going to give you 1 pixel of a straight line that has a color of black!  */
}

The first value in border represents how thick the border is!
You can also use keywords for that. EX: thick, thin
the second value is the border style!
the third value is the color of the border!

There is a property called border-radius!
This property will determine how round the vertex is!
If the value is 50%, it will be a full circle

EX: 
h2 {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 50%;
    /* It's a round circle */
}

margin:

This almost the same as padding!
just change the padding -> margin

EX:
h2 {
    margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
    /* top, right, bottom, left */
}

h2 {
    margin: 10px 10px 10px;
    /* top, right & left, bottom */
}

h2 {
    margin: 10px 10px; 
    /* top & bottom, right & left */
}

h2 {
    margin: 10px;
    /* top & bottom & right & left */
}
